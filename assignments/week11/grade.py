"""
Create a grade processing system with the following requirements:

A global variable passing_grade = 50

(1) A function input_students(num_students) that:

- Creates and returns a list of dictionaries
- Each dictionary contains: {'name': str, 'scores': [list of 3 scores]}

(2) A function calculate_averages(students) that:

- Uses nested loops to calculate each student's average
- Adds an 'average' key to each student dictionary
- Modifies the original list (demonstrate list mutability)

(3) A function display_results(students) that:

- Loops through students
- Uses the global passing_grade to determine pass/fail
- Prints each student's name, average, and status (PASS/FAIL)
